Shallow Water Equations
===

This project is a fork of the shallow water equations teaching code used for courses about high performance computing (https://github.com/oldenj/shallow-water-equations).
The goal is to reimplement the core functionality using the alternative runtime systems Charm++ and UPC++.
Compared to the original SWE teaching code, this codebase is simplified and refactored in order to acommodate the design of these frameworks.
Additionally, the MPI implementation is reworked as well.
